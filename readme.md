This Project is a fork from Brad Smith Project: 
https://github.com/bbbradsmith/NES-ca65-example

I changed it to make it work on Mac / Unix System.

# Compile project

Make sure to have cc65 installed
```
brew install cc65
```
Then in the main directory, run this script:
```
./compile_example.sh
```
